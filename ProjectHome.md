This is my java implementation of the BLAKE-512 cryptographic hash function (version 1.3).

BLAKE was created by Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Luca Henzen, Willi Meier, and Raphael C.-W. Phan. It is one of the finalists for the sha3 hash.


The specifications can be found here: http://www.131002.net/blake/
